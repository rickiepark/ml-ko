        This example page shows inference with a pretrained object-detection model
        that can classify and localize (i.e., give the position of) target shapes
        in simple synthesized scenes. The training happens in tfjs-node (see
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/blob/master/simple-object-detection/train.js">
        train.js
        </a>
        in the source folder).
      </p>
      <p>
        The target objects that we want to detect are triangles and rectangles,
        in the background are line segments and circles that the model should ignore.
        Each synthetic scene contains only one target object.
        Each inference by the model generates the bounding box of the target
        object (show as the blue box), which can be compared with the true
        bounding box (show as the red box). In addition, the inference output
        contains the class of the shape (triangle vs. rectangle).
